//Sliding Window Maximum : Given an array nums and an integer k, there is a sliding window of size k which moves from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

// ex: Input: nums=[1,3,-1,-1,5,3,6,7], k=3, output:[3,3,5,5,6,7]


public class SlidingWindowMax {
    
}
